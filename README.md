## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* A Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yashdiwan12/Obsidian](https://github.com/yashdiwan12/Obsidian)
    cd Obsidian
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key. You can do this with a single command:
    ```bash
    echo 'GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"' > .env
    ```

5.  **Initialize the knowledge base**
    ```bash
    python rag_setup.py
    ```

6.  **Start the application**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

7.  **Open the frontend**
    Open `index.html` in your web browser, or serve it with a local server for best results:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```
    The backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5001` and the frontend at `http://localhost:8000`.

## 📖 Usage

1.  **Ask Security Questions**: Use the **Threat Query** tool to get answers to your cybersecurity questions.
2.  **Analyze Suspicious Content**: Submit potentially phishing emails, messages, or URLs to the **Phishing Analyzer**.
3.  **Learn About Threats**: Browse the educational content to improve your security awareness and knowledge.

## 🔄 Updating the Knowledge Base

When you modify the `knowledge_base.txt` file, you need to rebuild the vector database for the changes to take effect.

1.  Stop the server (`Ctrl+C` in the terminal).
2.  Delete the `db` folder.
3.  Run the setup script again:
    ```bash
    python rag_setup.py
    ```
4.  Restart the server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Could not connect to server" | Ensure `app.py` is running in your terminal.                                     |
| API key errors                | Verify your `.env` file contains the correct and valid Gemini API key.             |
| Knowledge not updating        | Remember to rebuild the database after changing `knowledge_base.txt` (see above). |
| Import errors                 | Check that all dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  |
